## 👋 About Me

I'm a backend engineer who thinks deeply about system behavior after deployment—under load, during failures, and over time. My work centers on reliability, observability, and building software that degrades gracefully.

Most of my growth comes from investigating production incidents, tracing unexpected behaviors, and improving system resilience. I believe great engineering is methodical, empathetic to future maintainers, and grounded in understanding trade-offs.

```python
class Engineer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.focus = ["backend systems", "distributed computing", "reliability"]
        self.approach = "observe → reason → implement → validate → iterate"
        self.values = ["simplicity", "maintainability", "operational excellence"]
    
    def philosophy(self):
        return "Good code should be obvious six months later at 3 AM"

    def __str__(self):
        return """
        ╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
        ║                                        ║
        ║   "The system is the product of the    ║
        ║    process that created it." - W. E. D. ║
        ║                                        ║
        ╚════════════════════════════════════════╝
        """

## 🚀 Engineering Work

### **Production-Grade Flight Price Tracker**
*Building systems that run reliably without constant supervision*

- **Architecture**: Designed distributed microservices handling real-time price monitoring, user notifications, and booking workflows
- **Scalability**: Rearchitected synchronous processes into distributed task queues, improving throughput by 10x during peak loads
- **Reliability Engineering**: Implemented exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation—reducing worker crashes from daily to near-zero
- **API Integration**: Built resilient wrappers for third-party flight APIs with rate limiting, caching strategies, and fallback mechanisms
- **Observability**: Added structured logging and metrics collection for debugging production issues without guesswork

**Tech**: `FastAPI` · `Celery` · `Redis` · `PostgreSQL` · `Docker` · `AWS ECS` · `GitHub Actions`

---

### **Payment System Integration**
*Security and reliability where it matters most*

- Designed idempotent payment flows with proper transaction isolation and rollback mechanisms
- Implemented webhook validation, retry logic, and reconciliation processes for third-party payment gateways
- Built audit trails and anomaly detection for financial operations

---

### **Async Task Processing Infrastructure**
*Making background jobs predictable*

- Migrated blocking operations to distributed task queues with priority-based scheduling
- Implemented dead letter queues and monitoring for failed tasks
- Reduced average job latency by 70% through queue optimization and worker tuning

## 💭 Engineering Philosophy

> **Understand the system before changing it.**  
> The best debugging tool is careful thought. Read the code, trace the data flow, and form hypotheses before making changes.

> **Prefer boring technology.**  
> Choose tools that are well-understood, well-documented, and have survived production use. Novelty is not a feature.

> **Design for the maintainer.**  
> Write code as if the person debugging it at 3 AM is a slightly caffeinated version of yourself who doesn't remember the context.

> **Validate assumptions relentlessly.**  
> Production systems fail in unexpected ways. Test edge cases, simulate failures, and monitor behavior under real-world conditions.

**My process:**
```
observe system behavior
  ↓
reason about root causes
  ↓
implement targeted fixes
  ↓
validate in production-like environments
  ↓
iterate based on metrics and feedback
```

## 🌱 Open Source & Community

Currently studying open-source codebases with strong engineering cultures and preparing for substantial contributions. I value projects that prioritize:

- **Maintainability**: Clear architecture, comprehensive tests, and thoughtful documentation
- **Collaboration**: Inclusive code review practices and patient mentorship
- **Long-term thinking**: Decisions that optimize for sustainability over quick wins

**Interests for contribution**: Systems programming, backend infrastructure, developer tools, observability platforms
